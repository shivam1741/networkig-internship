# Day 1
On Day 1 of our Netwokring Internship, we brushed networking basics with the following topics:

- Definition of Networking.
- Components of networking
- Different types of Topologies : Star, Bus, Ring, Mesh.
- Types of Network: PAN, LAN, MAN, WAN.
- Learned the basic network flow.
- Discussed on common Network challenges: Unauthorized access, Data breach, Viruses.
- Additionally, we went through some performance issues in network: Network Congestion, Conneciton Reliability and Bandwidth limitations.

# Day 2
On Day 2 of our Networking Internship, We learnt more about LAN, MAN and WAN.  
## Network Planning Exercise  
### Scenario: 
You are IT consultant for "EduTech Solutions" - an educational software company.

### Company Details:
- Main office: 100 employees in downtown building
- Development center: 50 employees, 5 km away
- Regional sales offices: 3 locations across the state
- Remote workers: 25 employees working from home

# Day 3  
On Day 3 we learnt following things about Media Access Control (MAC) and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.  
- Definition of Network Addresses. 
- How IP and MAC addresses are different to each other.
- Key Characteristics of Physical address(MAC)
     * Physical Address: Burned into network interface card (NIC).
     * Unique Worldwide: No two devices have the same MAC address.
     * 48-bit Address: 6 groups of 2 hexadecimal digits.
     * Layer 2(Data link): Works at Data Link Layer.
     * Non-routable: Only works within local network segment.
 - Key Characteristics of IP address
     * Logical Address: Assigned by network configuration.
     * Hierarchical: Network portion + Host portion.
     * 32-bit Address (IPv4): 4 groups of decimal numbers (0-255).
     * Layer 3(Network): Works at Network Layer.
     * Routable: Can be used across different networks.
  - How MAC and IP Addresses Work Together.
  - What is Packet and how it transmit (form source to destination).
  - We got to learn what Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is and when it comes into play.
  -
