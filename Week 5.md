# Day 1 (DHCP)
## Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol(DHCP)

### What is DHCP?  
* DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.
* It’s a service that automatically gives IP addresses and network settings (like gateway, DNS, etc.) to computers, phones, routers — basically any device joining a network.
* Without DHCP, you’d have to manually set an IP for every device. Imagine doing that for 100 PCs — painful, right? DHCP saves you from that.

 ### What DHCP actually does

 

# Day 2(NAT and PAT)

## NAT, PAT & Ports

### 1. What is NAT (Network Address Translation)?

* NAT is a technique that translates private IP addresses used inside a network into public IP addresses used on the Internet.
* It allows private networks (like home or office LANs) to access the Internet using limited public IPs.

* ***It helps in:***
   * Conserving public IPv4 addresses.
   * Hiding internal network details from the outside world (basic security).
   * Connecting multiple devices using one public IP.

 ### 2. Types of NAT

* ***Static NAT:***
    * One private IP ↔ one public IP (1-to-1 mapping).
    * Used for servers that need to be accessible from the internet (like a web or mail server).
    * *Example:*
     192.168.1.10 ↔ 203.0.113.10

* ***Dynamic NAT:***
    * Uses a pool of public IPs.
    * When a private host sends traffic, NAT dynamically assigns an available public IP.
    * Once the session ends, the IP returns to the pool.
    * *Example:* Pool: 203.0.113.5 to 203.0.113.9 → used by many internal hosts.

* ***PAT (Port Address Translation):***
     * Also called NAT Overload.
     * Multiple private IPs share one public IP.
     * Router differentiates connections by changing source port numbers.
     * Most common type — used in home routers.

### 3. How NAT Works (General Idea)  
* When a device (say, your laptop) sends a packet:  
> Source: 192.168.1.10   
> Destination: 142.250.195.78 (Google)

* The NAT device (your router) changes the source IP before sending it to the internet:   
> Source: 203.0.113.5 (public IP)   
> Destination: 142.250.195.78


When the reply comes back, NAT reverses the process using its internal translation table.

### 4. What Makes PAT Different

* PAT does the same thing as NAT but adds one more twist — it also translates port numbers.   

* ***Why?***
     * Because if many devices inside the LAN share one public IP, the router must ensure every session remains unique.
     * *Example:*   
     
     |Inside Host|Private IP|Source Port|Translated IP|Translated Port| 
     |-----------|----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
     |Laptop|192.168.1.10   |50000      |203.0.113.5	|40001  |
     |Mobile|192.168.1.11   |50000      |203.0.113.5 | 40002 |

Even though both used the same port internally, PAT made them unique by changing their source ports.

### 5. Why Does PAT Change Port Numbers?

* Because multiple internal devices can use the same source port at the same time.
* If the router didn’t change them, it couldn’t tell which reply belongs to which device.
* *PAT keeps a translation table like this:*

|Inside Local|Inside Global|Destination|Destination Port|
|------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
|192.168.1.10:50000|203.0.113.5:40001|142.250.195.78|443|
|192.168.1.11:50000|203.0.113.5:40002|172.217.160.14|443|

When a reply comes to 203.0.113.5:40001, the router knows it belongs to 192.168.1.10:50000.

***So basically:***  
> NAT changes IPs  
> PAT changes IPs and ports to make every connection unique.

### 6. Which Port PAT Changes?
* Only the source port — never the destination port.
* ***Why?***
   * Destination port tells what service you’re requesting (like web, mail, etc.).
   * PAT doesn’t touch that because it would confuse the server.
   * PAT only changes source port to track each connection separately.
   * *Example:*
      > Before PAT:   
      > Source: 192.168.1.10:50000 → Destination: google.com:443   
      > After PAT:   
      > Source: 203.0.113.5:40001 → Destination: google.com:443
     Destination port (443) stays the same → the server still knows it’s a secure web request.

### 7. Role and Meaning of Port Numbers

* Ports tell what kind of application/service the packet belongs to.
* *Example:*
> 80 → HTTP (web)   
> 443 → HTTPS (secure web)   
> 25 → SMTP (mail)   
> 53 → DNS   
> 21 → FTP

* These are called well-known ports (0–1023).
When you type a URL like "https://google.com", your computer automatically picks port 443.

* So yes, you were absolutely right — ports tell your system and the server what kind of communication is happening.

### 8. How Your Computer Chooses Source Port

* Your device automatically chooses a random source port from a range called the ephemeral port range (temporary ports used for outgoing connections).

* Usually:  
Windows → 49152–65535  
Linux/macOS → 32768–60999 (can vary)

* Steps:

    * OS picks an unused random port in that range.

    * Assigns it to your new connection.
    * Uses it until the connection closes.
    * Frees it for reuse later.
    * So if you open 5 browser tabs:
    > Tab	Source Port	Destination Port   
    > Tab 1	51001	443   
    > Tab 2	51002	443   
    > Tab 3	51003	443   
    > Tab 4	51004	443   
    > Tab 5	51005	443

Each tab uses a different source port → no confusion in replies.

### 9. How Many Ports Do We Have?

* Total port numbers = 0 to 65535
* Divided into ranges:
 
|Range|	Type|	Use |
|-----|-----|------|
|0–1023|Well-known ports|	Fixed system services (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, etc.)|
|1024–49151|	Registered ports	|For specific apps/services|
|49152–65535|	Ephemeral (dynamic) ports|For temporary client connections|

So in theory, your device can open around 64,000 simultaneous unique connections at once — practically limited by CPU/RAM, not ports.

### 10. Example: Full Packet Journey Through PAT

* Let’s walk through a complete example:

> You open Google:   
> Source IP: 192.168.1.10   
> Source Port: 52000   
> Destination IP: 142.250.195.78   
> Destination Port: 443


> Router applies PAT:   
> Source IP: 203.0.113.5   
> Source Port: 40001 (changed)   
> Destination IP: 142.250.195.78   
> Destination Port: 443


> Google replies:   
> Source IP: 142.250.195.78   
> Source Port: 443   
> Destination IP: 203.0.113.5   
> Destination Port: 40001


* Router looks in its PAT table:

203.0.113.5:40001 → 192.168.1.10:52000  

It forwards the reply back to your device correctly.


### 11. How Port Numbers Relate to Tabs & Apps

* Every tab, browser session, or app uses a unique source port.
* That’s how your computer keeps connections separate.
* So yes, more ports = more simultaneous connections possible.

> But practically:   
> Your laptop can open thousands of tabs, not millions.   
> Limiting factor = memory, not ports.

### 12. Security & Real-World Notes

* NAT/PAT hides internal IPs, but it’s not a security tool — it’s more of an addressing trick.
* To protect networks, use firewalls with NAT.
