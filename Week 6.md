# Day 1(ACL) 
## ACL (Access Control List):
* ACL (Access Control List) is like a security guard in networking.
* It controls which packets (data) are allowed in or out of a network or device (like a router).
* In simple words:
> ACL decides who can enter and who can’t.
* ***Real-life Examples:***
     - Think of your router as a building gate.
     - People (packets) want to enter.
     -  The security guard (ACL) checks a list:
         > If your name (IP address, port, or protocol) is allowed --> you enter.   
         > If not --> you’re blocked.   
         
  So, ACL is that list of rules used by routers or firewalls to decide what traffic can pass.


### What ACL Can Filter:
* Source IP address (where data is coming from)
* Destination IP address (where data is going)
* Protocol (like TCP, UDP, ICMP)
* Port number (like HTTP = 80, HTTPS = 443)
