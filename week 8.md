# Network Troubleshooting Tools

## Ping

* It is a command that is used for Checks connectivity between two devices.
 ```

 ping 8.8.8.8
 ```

* In the image we can see clearly 4 packets has been sent successfully to a sever or device whose ip is 8.8.8.8.
* In the place of IP we can use DNS name (like google.com , cisco.com) too.

### How it works
ping sends ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Echo Request packets to the target host and waits for Echo Reply packets.
