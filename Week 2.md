# Day 1
On the 1st day of the 2nd week I got to learn about OSI Modal and its layers with function of each.
- To remember its layers into sequance we learnt a trick that is "All People Seem To Need Data Processing".
    * All- Application Layer(7)
    * People- Presentation Layer(6)
    * Seem- Session Layer(5)
    * To- Transport Layer(4)
    * Need- Network Layer(3)
    * Data- Data Link Layer(2)
    * Processing- Physical Layer(1)
  
## Example Where OSI Modal is followed: 
How OSI Modal is used when we access any web page.
- Application Layer- Browser works here, It give you the interface to request a web page.
- Presentation Layer- Here Data is encrypted so no one can read it, and compressed for faster tansfer.
- Session Layer- It create secure session b/w user and server.
- Transport Layer- Here we use UDP And TCP protocol, but in this case TCP protocol is used ensuring that no data is lost while transferring.
- Network Layer- The DNS will change into IP and Find best way to transfer data fast.
- Data link Layer- Here network interface card (NIC) puts the IP and source's Mac and router's Mac to every frames
- Physical layer- Data is sent as electrical signals(Ethernet cable) or radio waves(Wi-fi/Cellular networks(3G, 4G, 5G)).
