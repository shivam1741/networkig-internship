# Day 1
On the 1st day of the 2nd week I got to learn about OSI Modal and its layers with function of each.
- To remember its layers into sequance we learnt a trick that is "All People Seem To Need Data Processing".
    * All- Application Layer(7)
    * People- Presentation Layer(6)
    * Seem- Session Layer(5)
    * To- Transport Layer(4)
    * Need- Network Layer(3)
    * Data- Data Link Layer(2)
    * Processing- Physical Layer(1)
  
## Example Where OSI Modal is followed: 
How OSI Modal is used when we access any web page.
- Application Layer- Browser works here, It give you the interface to request a web page.
- Presentation Layer- Here Data is encrypted so no one can read it, and compressed for faster tansfer.
- Session Layer- It create secure session b/w user and server.
- Transport Layer- Here we use UDP And TCP protocol.
- Network Layer- The DNS--to IP and Find best way to transfer fast data.
- Data link Layer- Here network card puts IP and mac 
- Physical layer- data ready to transter via wifi and Ethernet.
